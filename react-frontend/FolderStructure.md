## package.json

- Contains the dependencies, and (react)scripts required for the project.

## node_modules

- Created whenever you use create-react-app command, or whenever installing libraries/dependencies with npm install.

## public/manifest.json

    -   Out of scope for application, not important

## public/index.html

    -   Only one index file per react project. All react components are updated/put in public section. 
    -   Dynamically updated, typically not modifying this file.

## src/App.js

    -   Root component (react functional component)
    -   Inside component there is JSX code (Javascript XML like code), extension of Javascript syntax (looks like xml code)
    -   JSX makes react code more simple and elegant

## src/index.js

    -   Whenever you deploy application on localhost:3000.
    -   Index html file will get served ->  index.js gets served (renders App(root component) ) inside div with "root" id in public/index.html through ReactDomRender function.
